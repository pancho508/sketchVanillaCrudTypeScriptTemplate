Should re format structure bro. more MVC ohh yeah.

THINGS TO DO 
1. **Linting and Formatting**: Ensures a consistent, clean code style and helps prevent common programming errors.  
2. **Testing**: Validates your routes and logic with automated tests, increasing reliability and maintainability.  
3. **Separate the Express App from Server Startup**: Allows easier testing and flexibility by isolating app configuration from the server listening process.  
4. **Organize Your Code (MVC-ish or Service/Controller Layers)**: Makes the application more modular and maintainable by grouping logic into distinct layers.  
5. **Use Migrations**: Manages database schema changes in a versioned manner, preventing messy, ad-hoc SQL updates.  
6. **Error Handling and Logging**: Provides a unified way to capture, log, and respond to errors, improving both debugging and user experience.  
7. **Environment Management**: Separates sensitive or environment-specific configurations from the code, allowing secure and flexible deployments.  
8. **Containerization**: Packages your app and its dependencies into consistent, portable containers, simplifying deployment across different environments.  
9. **Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automates testing and deployment processes, ensuring reliable code delivery and faster iteration cycles.  
10. **Example “Production” Setup**: Demonstrates best practices for a robust, scalable, and secure production environment (e.g., proxies, monitoring, process managers).
